My DD wrote a parody about Siddartha in high school. Had to do with shoes. Funny and clever.

Does Twitter let you know if your account was hacked? I got your message. No worries. I deleted it, thanks to the Twitter msg.

On the home page, I like the list of icons under the word Followers. All the colors, photos, graphics. It would make a cool poster.
