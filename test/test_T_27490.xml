You can copy a url from itunes, and paste in in safari.  Add any param (i.e. blahblah&amp;x=y) and it will avoid the cache

mega bad caching.  Try getting the url for the itunes page you want, paste it in to your safari address bar,&amp; add a param to it

Thanks for the feedback on that point.  Submitting scores to a global tracker is the thing I most want to add.

Ha - two subsequent tweets: @majicdave tweets above leaving dreamhost, and @zyote pimps them.  I'd stay well away myself. (Had pain 2y ago)

I wonder why Tane thinks 6am is a good time to get up these days.  He has a younger brother now, and suddenly it's a race to be first up?
