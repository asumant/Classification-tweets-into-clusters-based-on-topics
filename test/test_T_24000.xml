I don't see Apple in the NetBook space - at least not the way people currently think of NetBooks. Maybe next year tho.

I can't give predictions because if I'm right I'd burn sources. Let's just say that it should be more interesting than most think.

I agree that Apple is far too secretive. I DON'T agree that Jobs had obligation to release his medical cond. given it's not deadly.,

Made it to the speakers' lounge. They're making us get here earlier and earlier every year. They're promising breakfast this year!

By the way I was trying to be cute when I said &quot;dying&quot; but that didn't translate well. I'll probably never be able to be clever in 140 char.
