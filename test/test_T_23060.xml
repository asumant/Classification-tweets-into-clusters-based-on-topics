&quot;You Could Be Happy&quot; by Snow Patrol is a genuinely beautiful song. And Eyes Open remains a great album.

Having to pay extra for Fable II pub games is a con. But I'll probably end up paying it. Maybe.

Xbox Live is doing my tits in. Seems great, when it works. Set up a network bridge but after reset doesn't work anymore. Maybe try a hub?
