Oh brother. haha. It's all context my friend. It's okay to talk politics 24/7, it's not cool to make a hashtag the actual convo.

However, that is the problem. You cant assign 1500 ppl to a directory who are self-identified &quot;conservatives&quot; + expect poli action

There's an exercise you can do. Look at the quality of the stream between a Conservat who has their bio up v. someone who has tcot
