For me it's the only thing that works. I went a couple years of no caffeine except for the rare occasion of a migraine

I never use MySpace anymore. I find it so annoying that they email me birthday reminders but won't tell me whose birthday unless I log in.

Massive dose of caffeine I took for the migraine (http://bit.ly/mjce) worked but is predictably keeping me awake. Shoulda taken it sooner
