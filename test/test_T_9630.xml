Oh, Gary's got skill. Gary uses skills he's learned from watching Jason Statham movies to get the best deal.

So many people have asked 'Gary, why would you wear such a thing to court?' Honestly, I thought the redneck I hit would be drunk and naked.

Despite rumor, I have never spent the night with Michael Jackson in the 80's. It was 1997, and I was homeless.

Child star Candace Cameron lost 22 pounds. Easy to do when you haven't had a job in 13 years. I'm crazy buff. My baby abs are lethal weapons

People often ask me how I feel about 'Avenue Q.' Well, the last time I was near a puppet, Dudley asked where the bad man touched me.
