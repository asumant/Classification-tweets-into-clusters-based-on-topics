Thanks to Michelle, I had a wonderful and perfect Turkey Day. Just the right mix of food, drinks, and friends. I think it's my best ever.

Sea lions at wharf were cool. Chinatown was okay. I loved Japantown! Was surprisingly moved. On my way home now. Will miss the warm weather.

Sigh. Wish I had thought to look for goth clubs sooner. How embarrassing. Feel like a failure. That's what I get for straying from my roots.

Walked around downtown San Francisco after midnight, but it was boring and just made me miss Tokyo. People I saw were annoying or scary.

Not sure what to think of eXistenZ. Liked the idea of a war between realists and virtual realists. Also liked the erotic living game pods.
