Yeh, *that's* cold. Even when I lived in Montana it rarely went below -15C.

Radiolab is my favorite podcast. I love the interplay between Jad and Robert, and it's intellectually very stimulating.

I once got into listening to Bing and the Andrews Sisters doing Xmas music - but that was in July and thus safely ironic.

Pastebud only works between Safari/Mail, but you can use Twittermail to post a tweet.

With the ubiquity of Xmas music in public places is there *anyone* who listens to it at home? Is it purely a public thing?

Wife thinks me saying she dragged me to the baby gym makes her look bad, but she dragged me to s.t. good so I think it makes her look good.

Dragged out to a baby gym by my wife. First thing that happens is that Maia locks herself in the bathroom. Snow storm starting. What next?

Maia says &quot;baidand&quot; instead of bandaid. It's so cute. Also insisting on &quot;ice&quot; for every booboo. Oh, and she's much better today.
