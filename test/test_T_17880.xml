We have to do what we say, actions speak louder than words.  We can't assume they won't notice when we drop the ball...

Bingo!  You hit the nail on the head.  That's exactly what it all comes down to, lack of personal responsibility.

I haven't totally lost hope either, but I often feel at a loss.  People I consider smart just don't seem to get it.

The ones who aren't stupid are apathetic.  Willing to believe what they're told and not look into it further
