I run in running shoes, all others are tennis shoes. That might be different if I played tennis, I guess....

Precisely. Life seemed more fun when I didn't know what my boss's bathroom looks like. Seriously. She posted pics.

I have an email devoted only to Twitter. That's how paranoid I am. They're backing me into the corner.

Boss's non-existent boundaries (I could write a book) scare me on that... though it would be fun to tell HR that's why she fired me.

So help me, they'll never know I have a Twitter account. I need an outlet for passive aggressively insulting them.

Boss obnoxiously came over and said &quot;I added you&quot; and I caved in. I'm now also her ally on some kind of mafia game I don't play.

But that's assuming I spend 30 sec/tweet. It's usually way more than that because I'm way too wordy for this medium.

That's right Alabama. Go ahead and let them sack John Parker Wilson one last time. Really end his college career on a low note.

Andre Smith just can't be this essential to the game. I'm betting if Utah scores once more in the 1st, Nick Saban's head explodes.

Are you SERIOUS, Alabama? Do you realize that the game started a few minutes ago?

Facebook is becoming oversaturated with people I don't wish to add but feel obligated to do so. Such as, my boss and my mom's friends' kids.
