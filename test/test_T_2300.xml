I usually right-click, Save As the image from Etsy, save it to my PC, then upload it to my blog... is that what you're doing?

Yep - that's the main reason we bought the Wii - better family-type games. Get Mario Kart for Wii, so much fun!

Once I get used to the running section I think I might really enjoy that part of it, and I haven't even checked the yoga yet

I certainly will! The Wii Fit has a whole section on improving balance, which I'm horrible at - and laughing doesn't help!
