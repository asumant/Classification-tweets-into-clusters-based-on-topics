We didn't book the cattery early enough:-( Actually he's coping pretty well. Been outside and came back - my biggest worry.

There are better iPhone clients that Twitterific. Tweetie has @stephenfry seal of approval, but I'm waiting for @TweetDeck.

I can manage with just the iphone, probably. The house has broadband. Just not WiFi. I might just have to fix that...
