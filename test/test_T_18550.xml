Clint Eastwood may be done for, but I still love his reporter in True Crime. Don't care about Jesus, justice, or right or wrong. Just truth.

As little as I care for college sports, or being in SoMa on the weekend, I'd still like to be at the Emerald Bowl right now. Looks like fun!

For the record, what's sadder on a Friday night than a couple sitting next to each other on the couch arguing and then tweeting the results?

A decade ago, the Lock Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels script felt totally fresh and new. Now, it's an average episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.

Being in sales and loving the antics in Boiler Room or Wall Street is like being German and loving the antics in Triumph of the Will. Right?
