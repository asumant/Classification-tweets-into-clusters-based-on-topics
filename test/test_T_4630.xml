&quot;FIRE BAD!&quot; Yeh. Frankenstein. But Dick CHOOSES to be there.  So I get to make fun. When I have a stroke he can come kick my ass.

Wow, for $1500 it better do more than make coffee. I think Jura makes something lower end, Capresso Pro(?) For about $350.

Hope you enjoyed the Roots. How's that venue anyway? George Thorogood is playing there in a March. (Yeh I'm that old.)

Sweet. I'm more accustomed to neighborhoods where a kid tries to sell you a car radio--which you later learn came from YOUR car.

I'm not going with Cec &amp; T, so I'll be here. But they should be back by then as well.

I'm sentimental for Mavs. We had a '76 Mav 12 years ago. Not enough $$ to restore her so let her go. Ruby's a work in progress.

I really WANT to like the Killers--but can't get excited about them. They're like the Buzzcocks w/o the balls.

Happy New Year. Item one on my to-do list: stop writing 2008 on my checks. Yeh, that'll happen.

Maybe they should just drop Dick Clark from that damn tower and be done with it. Did I mention New Years is not my favorite holiday?

Max&amp;Ruby: Do you know what a surprise birthday party is?
Me: It's like a regular birthday party except people hit you in the face.
Surprise!

I think to cheer myself up, I'll get up at 6am, walk to the payphone up the street, and make random collect phone calls to hungover people.

Never a fan of New Years. Amateur drunks and clumsy adulterers crashing their cars and bodies into each other. And in the morning: regrets.

Had the 72 Ford out again today, before the weather got hinky. I think she appreciated the chance to stretch her legs, 2 days in  row.

From the Shake Things Up Dept.: Next time you order fast food at a drive-thru, do it like you're James Brown singing Sex Machine.
