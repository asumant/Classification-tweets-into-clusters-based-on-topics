Why meeting with a probate lawyer?  Would be better to meet with a lawyer who will help you avoid probate. :)

If she's already read the first 2, I think the last 2 are okay.  I don't recall them getting more sexually graphic.

Oh yeah, corn snakes are great.  They don't bite so long as you don't step on them or something.  And, they are beautiful &amp; happy.

Fortunately, she realized she didn't really want it before she went to far and showed up back in her cage.  How nutty!

Guess what?  Corney, our corn snake came back!  I guess her &quot;cage&quot; is a pretty nice place.  Warm, roomy, safe ...  so happy she's back.

So super sad. Our awesome corn snake got out of her cage, which is outside.  Very slim chance of finding her. :(
