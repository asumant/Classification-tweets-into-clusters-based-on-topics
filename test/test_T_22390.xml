If you create &quot;Desire&quot; in your audience while giving them a sense of &quot;Control&quot;, you've got a winner. This = same formula 4 World of Warcraft

I like the metaphor the author uses for the feeling of 'control'. 4 example, 1 of the biggest Vista mistakes is in how it treats the user.
