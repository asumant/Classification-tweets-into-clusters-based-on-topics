Jealous! Not just cuz it's gorgeous, but because Foxen pinots are some of my favorite wines ever. Hope you avoided tipsy drivers.

If you put off getting the flash, try making a DIY diffuser: http://is.gd/1etP I have a film canister but haven't tried it yet.

Tough choice. Only after looking back through my photos did I realize how much I use the Speedlight (&amp; I NEVER use the built-in).

I think lens. I have the equivalent Nikon speedlight and the exact same lenses you have. Could really use a tele lens for races.

I put the Grant's baits down on Monday, and the ants love it. They are all over it (and the kitchen, still). How long until it works?

I think all you can do is poison or trap them -- then you have to find and dispose of the carcasses or live with the smell (&amp; flies).
