Ah yes. We were all wondering why the students were getting them too. We got them multiple times. It was weird.

Very quiet. Looking forward to going home tomorrow and then looking forward to coming back a few days later. Haha.

I've often wondered this. The alarm used to go off all the time and we would just ignore it. What if it was real? Lol.

Ah, yes. IMDb list bugs me though, cause current &quot;trending&quot; movies jump up shortly and then disappear. Mostly a good list though.

Leaving work in hopes to avoid rush hour on LMD and the ensuing chaos that slippery roads + rush hour would provide.

Just got my book on C. Literally. It is titled &quot;A Book On C&quot;. Not the most clever title in the world, but it gets the point across.

Hmm. This is going to be an interesting query. Not really sure how I'm going to write this. Might just have to try something and hope...

Talking a walk over to Z's. Somewhat for an energy drink of some sort, partly cause I need to get up and take a walk.

Sucking on a Tootsie Pop that @mikerapin gave me. No, I don't think that sounds dirty. Get your mind out of the gutter.

Alright. I got the majority of the twitter template working. Moving over to JCP stuff now, as it really is more important. Just less fun.

One of my favorite John Mayer songs is on right now: &quot;Stop This Train&quot;. Pretty sure I have mentioned my love for this song many times.

Just looked up and out the window. Snowing a lot! Perhaps it has been doing that all day and I didn't notice.
