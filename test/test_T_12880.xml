if they received something in return for posting, its a form of PPP. I'm not saying I disagree with it. It's still PPP though

they're still a form of Pay-per-post. Izea is facilitating it, and they're a PPP company.

it means it's an easy thing for people to identify themselves. They are most likely already registered, as one of the 140 million.
