Thank you! :-) Just really upset- lots of new clothes I bought a week ago for the trip, plus it was an AWESOME suitcase. Alas...

Good luck. I'm sure your trip will be fine. I'd like to chalk my experience up to bad luck. Let us know how it goes!

Hi. Thanks! Miami to JFK. Worst part is baggage was lost. 12 hours &amp; they can't find it. But so much more was wrong about the trip.

Central America. There's limited Internet - you have to find Internet &quot;cafes&quot;, which aren't even cafes, so you can't use a laptop!

RT @linksmonkey: Why should I stay up late to watch a ball drop on New Years Eve? I watched George Bush drop the ball for 8 years. Rimshot.

Trying to recall everything that was in my suitcase that American Airlines has yet to find, 18 hours after we landed. Not happy about this.

The good part about being sick: chicken &amp; rice soup, white toast with grape jelly, Jell-O. The bad part about being sick: you're still sick.

I was wrong. You do suck. RT @davidbadash: Dear American Airlines, It's not that you suck...You're just somewhat incompetent and ridiculous.

Dear America, FYI, it is not a law, you are not required to wear your gym clothes when traveling by air. In fact, it should be illegal.
