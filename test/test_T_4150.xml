Ah, totally understand schnauzer gazing. We lost Heidi in late June just before her 16th birthday. Treasures indeed. :-)

Welcome to as well, Rhonda! Was thinking of our elderly mini scnauzer--she had pancreatitis and chocolate's a common cause.

Ack on the dog and the chocolate: hope it wasn't much--have heard it's bad for them.

Omigoodness: that was what I dreamed of every night of my childhood.  You rock!    :-)

Smiling about horses coming inside. I once wallpapered my barn. Vet said she'd never seen that before. Translation: You're nuts.

Greek turkey burgers for dinner. The irony: South Beach recipe . . . when South Texas is headed for a freeze tonight. Gourmet Yin and Yang.

Baking tip: Never wear black pants when making cookies. You WILL end up with flour handprints on your backside.

Shortbread baking. Smells heavenly. I add a touch of almond extract . . . same stuff I used for faux cyanide in one of my comic mysteries.

Cookie-dough tendonitis setting in. Must someday splurge on Kitchen Aid mixer. Always have to add the last cup of flour by hand. Ouch.

Blogging, then baking my shortbread cookies--stamped with cutesy design. Guaranteed to delight . . . and clog arteries. Oops: nurse thing.

Temperature dropping again. Our pastor (and next door neighbor) joked about wearing shorts yesterday. Maybe snowsuits by tomorrow. Texas!

Watched House--they try to humanize characters more, but not sure it's working. The only one I actually like is Wilson. But he's an enabler.

Emergency run to WM: hubby spilled/blew out his keyboard. Saturday before Christmas, and we were shocked how few people there. Not good.

Finished scene. A bonus since I don't normally work Saturdays. But playing ketchup. Which reminds me that I need to to think about dinner.

Finishing up a scene--so important in the last chapters to keep the momentum rolling, but tuck in all the loose ends too. Work, work.

House tidied, now at desk and ready to write new scene. Still tickled by publicist's tag for this series: &quot;  the medical hope opera.&quot;  :-)
