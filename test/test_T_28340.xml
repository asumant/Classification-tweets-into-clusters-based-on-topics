Belgian Goat Terriers are actually afraid of small animals such as squirrels and cats. It's characteristic of the breed.

Due to its rarity, the Belgian Goat Terrier is not a breed recognized by the AKC.

The name &quot;Belgian Goat Terrier&quot; was given by American breeders circa 1879. The Basque name for the breed is &quot;chien&quot;.

The &quot;goat&quot; and &quot;terrier&quot; bit comes from the little beards they have, similar to billygoats and terriers.

Belgian Goat Terriers are also not terriers at all, but herd dogs. And they were bred to herd sheep, not goats.

The name Belgian Goat Terrier is a gross misnomer. First, they're not Belgian, but were first bred by Basque shepherds.
