Well... they meowed the whole time -- whether they were locked in the carrier, or allowed to roam.  The vet can expect a visit...

Yea, we've had to deal with that before -- we're hoping that a larger carrier helps, but if today fails, we'll go to the vet.

&quot;The Love Guru&quot; did, however, put me in the mood to watch a good Bollywood film.  Any suggestions?

Favre was just intercepted in trying to make a comeback at the end of the game.  Too familiar?  I think so.  Jets on the west coast: 0-4

About to go on a little drive to test out the cat-carrier that we got for our trip to NC. Pray that my cats are able to respond well to it!

Amazed that the lowly #titans are on the verge of securing home-field advantage throughout the playoffs! This is great news for Nashville!

That was an amazing grab for the Steelers.  Not preferred, but they deserve that touchdown.  10-7 #titans

Wow... HUGE hit on Roethlisberger that causes a fumble on the 2 yard line.  Titans dodged the bullet on that one!

I saw in the Tennessean this morning that AT&amp;T is rolling out U-Verse to parts of Nashville tomorrow. Anyone have any more details?

Off to bed after a narrow Belmont loss (again) and Misty's wedding and reception. I'm definitely jealous of those already on vacation.
