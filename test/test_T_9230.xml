@firstdogonmoon must be a very special dog.  The only thing my dogs ever make would not be something I'd feature as an avatar.

And have her help clean up.  if there is pee on the floor, she wipes it up, she takes off the wet clothes too.  It can help.

If you put her in cotton underpants, might discover she dislikes it bit more to be wet. can be messy at first, but might help

Sons are very into the Justice League, older boy wants Flash pajamas. I googled and all I can find are &quot;hot flash&quot; pajamas. Um, not those.
