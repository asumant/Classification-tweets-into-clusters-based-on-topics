Spies and Snipers are frequently my downfall. Strangely, they're also often my best classes.

I've only read the last two of Zahn's Thrawn trilogy, and a two Jedi Academy books a long time ago.

It probably couldn't involve Han, Leia, Luke, etc. though, if it were live action. So that's a minus.

Darth Maul was about as horribly wasted as Sam Raimi's Venom was. Great potential, reduced to an afterthought of a villain.
