I thought he was fine-not a stand-out performance but not distracting. Didn't really think about his acting until now actually

We tried to see Benjamin Button-sold out.  Saw Valkyrie instead. Not FANTASTIC but good-interesting story. Sad (of course!)

Yay, sleep!  I don't know if I'll make it to midnight--small children don't get the &quot;sleeping in&quot; concept even on New Year's. :(

We talked about getting a sitter but decided Chickie does a pretty good job taking care of Zoodle. We paid her $20 &amp; ordered pizza.

wondered if he would--I saw another blog post about the book and he visited it too. So I think he must search for it. Cool!

Tweaked my whole wheat bread recipe yesterday--added homemade oat flour with some un-ground oats, &amp; added some wheat gluten. Nice texture!

Second night of night-weaning...only 10 minutes of crying!  And slept 'til 7:30!  HOORAY, ZOODLE!  I finally feel well-rested today.

I've decided I have to get Zoodle weaned off his very-early-morning feeding.  That meant some crying...but when he woke up @ 7 he was fine!

Borrowed one of my mom's vegetarian recipes for tonight. Wanted to make it more likable to The Engineer...so I added chicken.  :)
