LOL, sounds like mostly fun. (Not a big FG/AD fan) I just went on a 3.6 mile walk, which helped clear the head some. :)

I'm not Jewish, and, well, I could relate more to that list! I actually like the BWE blog, but, I love watching The Soup.

Any breakfast item including the word &quot;biscuits&quot; has to be well worthwhile.

That recipe's frosting was dumb. Followed it to the letter and I got this cottage cheese-looking sauce. Powdered sugar couldn't save it.

1 of 2 closets is a whole lot lighter. Do not feel motivation to clean the other one, though. (But it needs it... a lot.)
