I get a cold maybe once a year and I'm overdue. This one even tagged my mom and she NEVER gets sick.

Sounds like the version of the cold my boss has. Not sick enough to miss work but sick enough to wish you weren't there.

Just shopped for an hour in a Super Walmart. It was WAY too quiet for 9 days before Christmas. Easy shopping but unsettling, economy-wise.
