Dancing around the apartment to Footloose and loudly cheering for Kevin Bacon.  It's good to start holidays this way.

Nursing a slight hangover. Drinking lots of water and eating cereal.  Drinking with my brother is a bad idea but he buys me good vodka.

I am so mad I got a B in my Persian art class.  It's just because my teacher hated me.  She sucks and I will never take a class w/her again.

It's officially winter. Sigh. Snow boots and jackets abound. I miss fall and layering.  Although winter does give me an excuse to wear fur.
