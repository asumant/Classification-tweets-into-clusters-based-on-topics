Trying Rolando for another take on tilt. There, the mechanic was really built around it. (though loco roco is fine with analog!)

Of course, there is the question of what Automattic does with Intense Debate after the acquisition. More WP integration?

Do we really need those kind of heavyweight comment systems? Why not use OpenID/OpenSocial glue, etc. + built-in comments?

@lsherman My LHC synth would leak large amounts of helium and would contain a &quot;black hole&quot; preset.

What problem did you have with Steam? I'd much rather have Steam's liberal installs + community than use Direct2Drive.

Indeed, did get the BUG out + going. Next step: AWT double buffering for animation on the screen. Don't think that's been done yet.

We can never meet in person. Online, I'm Polyanna to your Scrooge. In person, we'd probably wind up agreeing about everything

At Tisserie by Union Square. Open wifi here getting a whopping 4kb/s! But it has coffee, and is NOT in the freezing, driving sleet!

Snowflakes do all sorts of wonderful things, as I live and work across a narrow alleyway from an NYC office skyscraper. HUGE flakes today.

I believe that tilt could work for control, but the game mechanic has to be built around it.  Katamari on iPhone? No. http://bit.ly/Lla2

While the talk is of Macworld and &quot;bloated&quot; trade shows, I've decided not to go to NAMM 09. It's a matter of my priorities and resources.

RT @PCMag: Apple's new Leopard updates are crashing people's computers. You might hold off on updating til they figure out the problem.
