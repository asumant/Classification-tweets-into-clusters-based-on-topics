that's tougher. it's hard to find one that is inexpensive, but one you won't outgrow too fast. Fender and Ibanez make dec. ones.

Jump in then. :-) You can learn your first song in a few weeks if you try. Seriously. After the first one, it gets easier. IMO

Looked up wake up call chords. If you just want to strum/pick and sing, it's pretty simple. 3 chords and not too bad.

Depends on the song. You could learn Rock you like a hurricane in an afternoon if you wanted, or Metal Health in about the same.
