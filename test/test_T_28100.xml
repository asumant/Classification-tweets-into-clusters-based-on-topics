I tried very hard to be angry about my human's disappearance behind the Big Door for so long, but found it more convenient to be petted.

Busy catching up on my rest after 5 days of vigilant monitoring of the comings and goings of the Pet Sitter. My human is finally home. Grr.

Moping. My human has her luggage out. The &quot;Pet Sitter&quot; tried to sweet talk me, but I am on to her. I am protesting from under the couch.

My human received a box from behind the Big Door. After she unpacked it, I thoroughly investigated it for vermin. Sadly, none was found.

Have business to conduct in the Realm (the conduit is through a portal under the couch) today. My human thinks I sleep under there. Ha!

Let my human hold me like a baby--for about 10 seconds. Then, I squirmed away. I may be neutered, but I have my pride.

Napped with my human today under the lavender blanket. Very cozy. It was unfortunately cut short by my human's short attention span.

More under-the-couch time today. The human who cleans the house is here. She's very fond of a contraption called a vacuum. Very scary.

Fought with the string-on-a-stick animal this morning. I'm pretty sure I killed it. The effort mandated a post-battle nap. And a snack.

I feel that I have perfected my adorability factor when I nap. My human kept coming over to pet me. I rewarded her by purring.

Knocked over the silk tree in the living room last night while my human was sleeping. I thought I saw a bird in there.

My human has plied with with treats today. Her way of apologizing for the V-E-T fiasco. I'm sure she learned her lesson. No more V-E-Ts!!

Turns out, I don't like the V-E-T. They poked me with sharp objects and commented on my girth. Very rude. My human is a turncoat.

Oh the indignity!! Despite my vocal protests, my human persisted in her efforts to stuff me into a little cage. I was taken to the...V-E-T.

My human offered me a treat with calming properties. I rejected it, of course. Despite past enjoyment, I do not like to eat predictably.

That thing I said about being fussy about my appearance? Scratch that. I like a soft coat, but I draw the line when it comes to pedicures.

Got a brushie from my human. Finally! I am fussy about my appearance, but my brushie schedule is sporadic. Humans are so hard to train.

Nap. Snack. Patrol house. Kill feather-on-a-stick. Repeat. It's a satisfactory existence. I will not complain. Much.

Santa did not visit. I listened for reindeer hooves on the roof for hours, but detected none. Why are pet children less deserving, I ask?

Listening to that horrid &quot;vacuum&quot; animal roar. I would attack it and kill it, but my human is strangely attached to it. It eats cat fur.
