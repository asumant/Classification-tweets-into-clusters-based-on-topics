But if it were not for Troughton's success as the second Doctor, it may have ended altogether there in the 1960's.

Don't bash on Troughton. (re: The Chronic Rift - Ep. Two). Even though there's so little complete eps, he is still outstanding.

Since cyborg technology was common in the Star Wars universe, I wouldn't be surprise if there were some Cyberwookiees.
