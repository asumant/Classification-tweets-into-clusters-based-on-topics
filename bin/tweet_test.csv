I've been living with my own most hated FB photo for a while so I hear you. Now if the photo was incriminating...

"

This is true. It was a post on social media etiquette (that said something similar) that got me thinking about it in the 1st place.


@GeekyChic @ahrycyk I might have to do that. But doesn't the owner of the photo get a notice when you untag yourself?


I ain't mad especially since after Friday I'm off for the rest of the year. :D So don't pay me any mind lol.


Good morning. Send prayers and positive thoughts your way! I hope everything turns out ok.


There's a twitter account too - @healemru. Reading his story has convinced me to join the Bone Marrow Registry.


Thank you! :D


I'm ok - less mad but things are still kind of tense here.  How are you?

I'd like to - what's the venue?


I think my youngest was quite excited to play with Tom's son - once he decided not to be shy in front of our visitors!


When my eyes get sore is a good reminder to have a break.


I appreciate your offer. Thnx.


Hmmmmm... that sounds pretty close to emotional blackmail 2 me.


Have to agree with @deangroom here - my wife thinks that mind reading was part of the deal.


Now you just have to work on your accent - try talking through your nose like I do.


My guess is from left to right - Steve Tom and yourself? Hoping to host @tombarrett myself in the coming week.


Check my blog for my POV and some links (not advertising I hope) to explain yr dilemma.


Just finished New Year's Day lunch at the in-laws - ate more than my share of the cherries.


Not going out anywhere for NYE - relaxing instead and traversing the web.

mash is the concept.


Great evening having @tombarrett and family over for dinner whilst he was in Adelaide.


Relaxing watching the kids in the inflatable pool - just hot enough.


Waiting for it to get dark enough to take kids out to see Xmas lights.


Back from the very unplugged town where my parents live - my Dad still calculates his GST using his working Windows 3.1 PC!


Might go and play NFS on PS2 - I know I'm a few years behind in my console gaming experiences.


When will people learn that Facebook is not a smart place to thumb your nose at your employer? http://snipurl.com/8v9v2


Waiting for the floor to dry after my mopping - oldest son reading in his room wife and youngest out to play lunch - so checking the web.


Catching up with a teaching mate tomorrow for golf - hiring a golf cart so we can talk more - walking can be anti-social when I hit the ball


Can't remember but it was at the time ;)

1st Feb!


Go for it girl!  They will carry your bags.  I said so!

It is.  If you reach our booking agent he will have all details on our availability. www.bandfromtv.org


Not enough wax in the world.


Baseketball was a really fun film to shoot.  One of those odd cult comedies.  Matt and Trey are great guys.  Not great actors.


ALL proceeds the band brings in (almost 2 mil over the last 2 years) goes right out to our charities.  List on our website.


www.bandfromtv.org would LOVE to play Pendleton.  We are making arrangements to play Vandenburg.


Best.  Compliment.  Ever.


No YOU'RE awesome for following me.


Oh and Thanks to @RickMacMerc for hooking it up.  Or as I like to call him Slick Rick!


you are the rock star!  I had a blast and can't wait to do it again.  Already having MacOSKen withdrawls!!!!  Thanks man.

I'm speaking at the AES American Epilepsy Society conference.  I'm the 50th advocate on EpilepsyAdvocate.com.

I get it.  You have a lot of secrets and don't want me poking around in there.  Not a problem.  Thanks for following me.


is a very smart man.


just gave me an idea.  Cinnabon with ranch instead of frosting.  I like it.


and I will call security as well.  Pat your head?  What?


we've talked about this already.  You're in for sure.  Can I visit YOUR set is the question?  And I hate olives BTW.


Both.


that is a dangerous WINK my friend.  Klowenberg visiting me on the set today I hope.  Call me when you land buddy.


sounds good.  Contact our booking agent Seth.  His info is on our band site www.bandfromtv.org  Thanks much


a dvd copy would ROCK. But just a link to it on-line would also rock.  Or a...whatever.  Thanks much.


What is that?  Where can I find it?


is asking me to stop sending pics from the set.  Or at least that's what I'm getting.


I think something has been living IN that hair for years.

your movie tees are awesome.  Love them.  Check 'em out peeps. Thanks and congrats on you making the list as well.

just got the fish I caught at Pike's Fish delivered by UPS.  Yummy.  Huge box.  Bagel Lox and Cream Cheese anyone.  on me.


must find a way to INCLUDE those who have purchased the DVDs already.  If not can't do the auction.  Not fair.   Still hungry.


Amazon is actually going to run an auction in January giving away signed guitars by the band.  Very cool.  But I need something bigger.


ebay the experience... good idea but again that would just appeal to the richest of folks.  Not my true peeps.


You now what @funkyp56 I hate your character so there!


Probably wouldn't do it until I had over 10K following me to make it great.  Just found an oreo under a couch pillow.  Won't kill me...


Good point @mattredman must work out the travel part.  Could be done.  I know a guy.  I feel like a calzone for breakfast why not.


More Thoughts:  Don't know if that would work.  But I like steak and eggs.  And ranch dressing.  My mind is wondering...


Maybe I can tie it to the sale of our charity band DVD on www.amazon.com/bandfromtv  Buy the DVD keep your rec. and I draw a number... hmmm.


My Thoughs: Must create some Twitter contest for charity where someone gets to hang out with me on the set for a couple of hours... help...


Who else wants to visit me on set?

So the hugs seemed to have worked out for most.  bartowski is asking for daily GRUNNY MISSIONS... who's with that?


That guy int he elevator was totally shocked.  First cause he watches Heroes then by the bear hug I gave him.  NIce!


Who hugged a stranger today?  I did.  Casting director for American Dad Linda.  Not really a stranger since she hired me but...


100 X 100 is a cheeseburger snake.  Ladies?


hug somebody you do NOT know today.  Just cause...


NO MEAT.  I hear that girl LOVES THE MEAT!!!!!!


Try a 4X4.  4 patties of beef and 4 slices of cheese animal style.  Then ask the EMTs use the paddles cause you'll need em...


Animal Style Fries: noun.  Meaning 'In N Out' french fries slathered with cheese grilled onions special sauce and TLC.  Call 911 asap.


I never said I didn't won it.  I just said it is confusing me.

Get your tough hard hitting questions ready for the Podcast.  Bring it bitches!  I just had a double latte... YEAH!!!!!!!


Oh... to have people to twitter for me.  One day!  One day!  Uhhhhhgggg... sorry bad dream... wooof!  Shake it off!


must say @dhlawrencexvii has been my favorite villain so far.  In all 3 seasons that is.  He rocks as an actor and a person!

Her name is Derby...she was rescued in Kentucky. I know her eyes are very different.


I saw your Husky in FB...very cute! It was NJ Puppy Rescue in Hampton (Warren county).


German Shepherd/Husky mix 7 weeks old. She was abandoned in Kentucky (hence her name). A NJ puppy rescue was fostering her.


@PMKU Thanks!


Thanks Kay! :-)


Ha! I hope not! We are preparing ourselves for our first night with the new baby...planning on not much sleep. We'll see...


Thanks! @JayGregory just left to pick her up! I'm sure I will have a lot more pics coming soon.

The kids and mommy and daddy. :-)


German Shepherd/Husky mix


And she's so soft and cuddly...It was hard to leave without her tonight!


Yes they think she's a German Shepherd/Husky mix. We're still working on her name!


@aranarose Thanks! It was so adorable seeing my 23-mo old with her...this is going to be fun!


No name yet. We're picking her up tomorrow night and hopefully will have a name then!


LOL. I felt like it was late! Glad you got it. :-)


Of course not. We'll see what happens tomorrow. Did you have a good bday?


I don't think so but thanks. Most of it is kid- and personal-injury related. Ugh.


@mayhemstudios  Thanks for the article RT! :-)
