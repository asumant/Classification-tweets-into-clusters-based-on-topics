Haha just burst out laughing. Supposedly the MBTA is OK in snow, just bad with rain. But #MBTAsux is still true.

if it's a cell phone, the missed call will show up and I'll know you want to talk. No need for a VM that says &quot;call me back.&quot;

Depends how it's done. If it's good, ask to differentiate as fan page, not official. Bad, I'd say compete or petition to take down
