Don't know if it really counts as procrastination if you do other chores in its place. ;) Not lazy-procrastination, anyway.

I understand. Working on 2009 budget proposals for an upcoming meeting. Definitely not at the top of my Weekend Fun list.

Thai food! A nice green curry and some tom yum soup, and a Thai iced tea... that's the way to go! :)

Yes, if I'd picked the cards they would have been the non-glittery variety. Looked like a 15 year old raver girl afterward.

Also, I really dig the backlit keyboard on my (older) 15&quot;, and that's about the only other thing the 13&quot; MacBook is missing.

I say last 15&quot; MB Pro unless you don't care about Firewire and ExpressCard slot. If that's the case, new 13&quot; MacBook is great.

Yes, I suppose that works... so long as you don't get caught up in Laundry Theory, or the dryer is like a CS Lewis wardrobe.

That'd be one heck of a remote start! Get yourself a power inverter and then sew some seat covers made of electric blankets. :)
