Oh, and McD's when I was 16. The hardest work ever for £2.60 p/h. I'm sure I don't need to explain why it was so cack.

Coucil, processing Housing apps for £7.52 p/h. Thoroughly depressing, and they expected too much from me for the cash. You?

The same happened over here, and now the mid range sub-£10 wines are using them. The stigma is changing.

OK, dilemma. I'm having my hair cut in an hour, yet my hair is like crap from yesterday. Do I wash it, or wear a hat and let them do it?
