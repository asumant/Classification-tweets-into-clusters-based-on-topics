Definitely don't miss the weather in AB! Stay warm and bundled up.  Good luck with the shopping, and Merry Christmas.

Was blowtorching pipes the other day. My friends coffee shack froze up. Places that aren't used to low temps, aren't set up for it.

Just spent 1/2 hr on the phone with them. There's nothing I can do, it's a CND PP account, all money out of it must be in CAD.

4 more sleeps to a 4 year old means we must get trained up on our early morning rising. 6:30 just isn't fair when it's my morning to get up!
