I find it interesting &amp; cool that my two favorite musicians (Dave Matthews &amp; Marc Broussard) are both Capricorns like me. Happy b-day to us!

Just spent WAY TOO LONG reading Dave Matthews' Twitter updates. He likes to reply to people and Twitter while on the toilet.

Tina Fey's updates on Twitter are AWESOME.  She really did deserve the Entertainer of the Year title they gave her!

Does anyone else get little crushes on people from their past once they reconnect with them on Facebook?  Good times.
