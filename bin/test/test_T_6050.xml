Wasn't implying otherwise on the low budget thing - just that didn't seem to fit CH's priorities. I guess that's business :)

Not the entrepreneurs, nor, perhaps in this case, the audience. More risky than HP - older actors, less built in timeframe.

There are risks involved, but the fact is that the movies need to be made, and in a timely fashion. Vision is for the artists.

It entered my mind as well. HP benefited from the moving fwd. What's done is done, but financiers learn.

Abstinence = short term financial opportunity. The transition is tricky, and moreso post Britney.

Perhaps the financials are over-riding the vision of book to screen. As CH's release suggests. Understandable.....

Nor did 13 have sparkles.Unless you count sparkles under the influence. Which I don't. Twilight abstinence must be in all areas.
