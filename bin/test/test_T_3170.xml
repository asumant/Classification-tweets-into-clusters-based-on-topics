And THEY must include enough info in reply, but do not, and thus I do not follow them if they offer too many bad @replies! Get it?

Just don't start all your updates as @replies. I can see them, but most of my followers who aren't following you won't. The end.

Wienerschnitzel is a no-brainer. Thin veal with a savory breading and lemon slices. Try Cordon Bleu for a real treat!

You can follow 1,000 people and read their updates, but if they don't follow you back, they don't know your updates exist. Confuses newbies.

When I check a follower and they have lots of @replies or very few updates, I rarely follow them back. Part of how I manage my timeline.

Walmart now selling iPhones. So more can stay connected with fancier gadgetry, but isn't it the real luxury to be inaccessible for a while?
