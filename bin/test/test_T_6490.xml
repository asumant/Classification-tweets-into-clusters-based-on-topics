Meta-tweets are a bit strange esp. since the medium is in its infancy. Maybe it's cuz we now skip directly to the self reflective stage

Noticed that a lot of the tweets are meta: tweets about how to tweet &amp; how to blog. V useful, but strange that there'd be so many.

First official day back at work: 2009 kinda feels like 2008. Let's hope it's a lot better though.

Intrigued by the whole e-book thing. I think it's going to tip soon. I won't take the plunge yet: will wait for Amazon and Sony to do battle

Just finished Gladwell's The Tipping Point: I wonder if Twitter has allowed for any trends to tip?

Compiling the all time best Xmas playlist: I'd say that Feed the World has gotta top the list followed closely by Fairytale of New York.

It's refreshing to walk down new streets in San Francisco. Just saw three cool new hang outs - Terroir, Beerspot and Laundromat (a cafe).

Sucks to be sick. Feels like it takes twice as much energy to do anything. Plus you can't really taste anything. Stay healthy everybody!

California weather is like Connemara's: rain then sun, or rather rain &amp; sun.  A spectacular combo of grey and orange/red/brown.

Made it through another Christmas party today. Seems like the more you go to, the easier they get. Kind of like most things in life, right?

Have a coherent vision for my online presence (I think): Twitter-Keep the group small cuz I actually update it. Facebook-Invite anybody.
