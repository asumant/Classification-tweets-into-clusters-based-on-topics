Sounds like a good resolution! I will make the resolution as one to meet by 2009's end, too expensive to buy all at once.

I think the biggest hurdle of &quot;cloud media&quot; will be the net neutrality problems we will face, blu-ray is a nice supplement

iTunes has pretty good quality on their small offering of HD titles. abc.com has fantastic quality on a few shows as well

It doesn't have bells and whistles as I see so far. But the pop up menu looks way cooler than many I've seen. The quality is great too.

Being that I think it would be a waste of time to give me a ticket for the darn incident. I think it was the same cop from a few months ago

Got a warning. He was just looking for an excuse to run my licence it looked like. He was nice. It went as bad as it could really.

He is still in his car with my licence. Hopefully no ticket. That would be unfair. Didn't know it was a dead end.

Stopped by a cop for not signalling at least 100 feet before a turn. He just wanted to pull me over.
