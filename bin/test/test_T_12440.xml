Understood.  But is disclosure insufficient only when we say it is?  Seems like a circular argument.

What if the co. is *already* doing that?   How much of his health is material?  At what point is disclosure complete?   Not easy.

We're in agreement on 'material' aspect.  How does media balance conflicting goals of privacy vs. disclosure?   Is it possible?

I have mixed feelings: yes, it is material to Apple.  But Steve &amp; his family should have some privacy.  How do you balance the two?

If the latest rumor about Steve Jobs is true, I feel bad for him &amp; his family.  This shouldn't play out like a Britney story.
