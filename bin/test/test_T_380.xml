Fusebox, ColdBox, CF on Wheels, Model-Glue and Mach-II are the big ones. FB is the hugest, but CFWheels is RoR for CF. CB is nice

I never think being sick is that bad until I catch something. At least a marathon session of The Wire has kept me feeling good. S2 finale!

Magic Wok on Conroy and Turkey Lake is now my favorite Chinese food restaurant in Orlando. Delicious fresh made noodles and pork buns!
