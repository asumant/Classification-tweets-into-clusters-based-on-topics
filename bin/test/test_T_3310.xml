Survived the 1st snowstorm of the season.
Its sad watching people lose it over 1+ feet of snow.          
They think the worlds ending!

It may not be the best way to build an empire but it pays the bills for now.

I find it amusing that I'm willing to be thought a fool as long as my word is not questioned.
In the end all we really have is our word.
