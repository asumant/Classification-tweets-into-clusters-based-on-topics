I think the crowds are making the most of shopping while they still can! Agree w/you about Adams, &amp; they won't be the last :-(

I always find days between Xmas &amp; New Year brilliant for reflecting, decluttering &amp; planning. How about you?

It wasn't as cold as I thought (though still had to de-ice the car). Roads are lovely and quiet - unless you're heading for the shops ;-)

Another bright but very cold day here. Will have to go out for a walk later ... today is a day for 'pottering about' ... no need to rush.
