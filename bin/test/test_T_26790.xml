Just ate a Xmas cookie. But I went running this morning. I probably negated my entire caloric burn in the first bite of the snowman's head.

Happy Chanukah everybody...the holiday of miracles, if you believe in that stuff. Maybe this year I'll believe &amp; pray for something divine.

Just recognized at the mall by a guy who fell in love with a girl he met online who was apparently pretending to be me. What a weird story.
