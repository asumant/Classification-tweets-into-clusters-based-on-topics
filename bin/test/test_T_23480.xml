Just a re-do of a previous one. They took x-rays and were unhappy with one of the fillings. So they re-did it..  for free!

It is surprisingly hard to drink out of a glass when your left upper lip is completely numb. A straw helps, but only slightly.

Finder is taking ~10 seconds to display the contents of a folder. AppleCare recommends Archive &amp; Install. Anyone seen this? (OS X 10.5)
