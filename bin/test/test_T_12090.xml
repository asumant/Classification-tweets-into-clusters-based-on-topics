Why do you have to qualify that statement with &quot;in a C# project&quot;? :) Sorry, VBers. That was just plain mean on my part...

@haacked Yes, your assumption is correct. R#r builds its own AST and caches it in _ReSharper.&amp;lt;SlnName&amp;gt; or TEMP.

I haven't found the additional R#r files to be a problem. R#r can store caches in TEMP if desired. R#r Options... General...

If you're running any ReSharper add-ins, I would try disabling them as I've found some can cause stability issues.

When I read the xunit docs, it sounded like you got one T per typeof(T) rather than per-class that used T.

You can achieve much the same result as per-assembly setup/teardown if IUseFixture&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; creates one T per typeof(T). Thoughts?

xunit's IUseFixture&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; creates a new T per test class/fixture. So it's not usable as per-assembly setup/teardown for starting a webserver.
