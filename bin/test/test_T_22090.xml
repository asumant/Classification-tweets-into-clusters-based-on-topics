That previous tweet was complete drivel designed to promote @smallbusiness . Not like all my other drivel here designed to do nothing.

I think Titans will need to beat Steelers twice to get to Superbowl. If they lose Sun., it will mean having to win in PItt in Jan. Not good

Oh well. The Titans are going to have to gain homefield advantage the old fashioned way. By beating the Steelers next Sunday.

This Ravens-Steelers game is making me more nervous than the Titans game did. I think there's a good chance it will go into OT.

Shoe throwing has inspired puns from @bruingeek @davidhhendricks   Shoe droped, Thrower had no sole. Socked it to him. Gave Bush the boot.

I still think Bush's head-fake shoe dodge will  long be remembered as 1 of his most adroit moves and one of the highlights of his presidency

And despite what the CBS announcers said many times, next week's Steelers-Titans game is in Nashville, not Pittsburg. I'll be there yelling.

This means the Titans - Steelers game next week will likely be a 'playoff' game for who gets homefield advantage thru the AFC playoffs.

This makes Steelers Titans game next week a contest for who gets home field advantage thru the AFC playoffs. Should be a great game.

In my 10 years of watching the Titans, that was the most incredibly un-Jeff Fisher play call. No other play even come close.

Titans 9 Texans 10 - This is formulaic Titans game. Grind away. Wear them down. Bore the opponents into turnovers. It's why they're 12-1.

Las Vegas has #Titans +2 underdog. I think that's about right. My controversial suggestion: Start Vince Young. Chances it will happen: None.

I think #Titans can beat the #Steelers, I just don't think they can today. 2 injured pro-bowlers and a slumping QB make Titans my underdog.

Heading later to one of the most strange #Titans games ever. The team is 12-2 but nobody thinks they'll win including, most strangely, me.

It seems @hammockinc is giving away one of our cool T-shirts to someone who 'shares a passion' by 6 p.m. eastern. Odds are high you'll win.
