Seriously! This is the 1st time I'm not with my family. I miss the good food. Shish kebab, pilaf... (This is @kpho at home, btw.)

Hm? I'm working at the tv station - the news doesn't stop for winter holidays. Hooray.

I keep having the opposite happen to me. I order peppermint hot cocoa, and they give me peppermint mocha. Don't like coffee.

Computer-assisted reporting. Most sites use a CMS - limited code knowledge required. Database skills are more sought after, IMO.

Wish other PR types would get that through their heads. I get spam, glamour shots, massive e-mail attachments ... you name it.

They'd be right at home in #Phx. Tailgating at 65 mph? Driving 10 mph below the speed limit in the fast lane? Check &amp; doublecheck.

Apparently the Arizona Republic added a $1-$2.50 surcharge to deliver Thanksgiving Day papers with Black Friday ads to subscribers.

It's all good. :) I completely understand about long weeks - I'm the only one running the station's Web site for most of the month.

What's worse is that we keep hearing about all the food banks that are running out of food. It breaks my heart every single time.

You're quite welcome; however, I don't live in Austin (I've never been to Texas, actually), so unless the show's in Phoenix...yeah.

Ugh. It's still a long week. I can't get excited about Christmas at all... maybe because the prospect of working is uncool.

Someone needs to remind me to eat during these 12-hr shifts at work. I've lost 6-12lbs in 2 weeks; I normally weigh less than 100lbs. Yikes.

I actually thought I was going to get stuff done today. Guess not. It feels like Murphy's Law kind of week: anything that can go wrong, will

I'm not kidding when I say he's not a good teacher. His version of teaching? Sit behind me &amp; watch me do it while I explain nothing. Uncool.

They cancelled it based on feedback from when my boss gave it - he's not a good teacher. It would've been better this year; I was giving it!

I just found out my station cancelled the web workshop for the Jan. fellowship program. Is it just me or does this make absolutely no sense?

Ever have days where everything should seem fine, though perhaps a bit disappointing, but somehow you just feel weary? I'm definitely there.
