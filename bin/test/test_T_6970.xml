But, at least I know that none of that is what Christmas is all about. And that is what makes it bearable. But I'll be honest, still sucks.

And even though I won't open a single present, and I have nothing to look forward to tomorrow, I brought presents with me for my wife &amp; son.

And even if the tree I put up is over 750 miles away, and the next time I see it I'm taking it down to burn, my son is only 3ft away.

And though my back feels like broken glass after 30 hours, and I have a rock hard mattress to sleep on, at least I'm under a roof.

I've arrived. I travelled for 30 hours, and after 15 minutes here, I'm ready to go home. This sucks. This REALLY sucks.

You would think driving 6 hours in any direction would lead out of Indiana. You'd be wrong.

One place always had a poker game going on. It was real mixed. Lots of bi girls, so as young men, it was the fun place to hang out.

Free beer, good looking women, etc. And sometimes you came across a &quot;family&quot; party. We'd make a beeline out, to their amusement.

As a young adult, I partied very hard. I drank, smoked a little pot, and have forgotten most of the names of the people I partied with.

I was born to a single mom, I have a black brother, and I went to prison young, and I spent time in a group home for kids.

I think I need to clear the air for any readers. I haven't yet gotten any responses attacking me as a gay basher, but I suppose eventually.
