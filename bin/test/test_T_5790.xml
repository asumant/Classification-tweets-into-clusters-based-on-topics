Do you think J will notice? Or should you just put his gifts next to his computer while he plays Wow and hope for the best?

Told you. Better get something to get all the crumbs out of the keyboard. Remind him to eat and go to the bathroom. He's gone.

Sorry - my bad eyes saw the &quot;J&quot; as an &quot;I&quot;. Take a picture to remember him by; WoW is highly addictive. Many of my co-workers play.

Are you the dad from Christmas Story who has to engage in battle, weaving a web of profanity that hangs over the state to this day?

Why are so many cookies covered in red sugar? Cuz the easiest way to clean up 8 yr old's sugar spill is to dip cookie in icing, then sugar.

Kids more interested in decorating the cookies than eating them. Dog has flour streaks in her fur - she looks like a skunk.

Per Norad, Santa was over Russia. Does that mean Sarah Palin could see Santa from her house?

Only one awake. 12 hours until the madness begins. Must go bake cookies so girls have sugar to fuel the frenzy.

Back home. Still need some stocking stuffers; I'll get them tomorrow. Kids are tired. I'm tired. Mall was not bad, though - small lines.

No one is going to the mall. Everyone is going to Target. We found mall parking, now at Bertucci's. No problems. Sweet!

8 yr old just did a face plant on our driveway - dang ice! School party treats everywhere. No injuries requiring bandaids, luckily.

8 yr old placed different Disney fairies within the lighted garland going up to the stairway. To protect us, she says. She's too cute.
