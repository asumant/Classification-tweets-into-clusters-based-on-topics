Dammit, I'm turning into Dad.  Just fell asleep on the lounge watching the cricket.  Not that it was boring, I'm just completely stuffed.

Right, I really need to cut back how much I drink on the weekends.  I swear I feel a little worse each time.

This cheap petrol thing rocks.  I have never filled my car up for less than $75-$80.  Today, $62.  Recently it's been up over $100.  Awesome

I've discovered that my brain isn't really in gear today.  Might head home later and work from bed.  Maybe.

Logitech and I have differing opinions on the definition of the word 'critical'.  The mouse has had &quot;critical&quot; batteries for days now.

Thank Christ for air-conditioning.  Today is supposed to be absolutely boiling - and I'm going to spend it in an office with no windows. Win

Just went for a walk on the treadmill.  3k's in 45 minutes and I'm completely fucked.  Stark realisation of just how out of shape I am.
